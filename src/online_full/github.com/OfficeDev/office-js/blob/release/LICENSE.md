&nbsp;   1. \*\*Distributable Code.\*\* The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute (a) as part of the Authorized Apps you develop; or (b) in a stand-alone manner, but for the sole purpose of enabling the use of or updating the Authorized Apps you develop, if you comply with the terms below.

1\. \*\*PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.\*\* If you are using a pre-release or beta version of the software, the terms of this section also apply to the pre-release or beta software:

&nbsp;   1. The software is a pre-release version and is provided "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE." It may not operate correctly, and it may be different from the commercially released version.

&nbsp;   1. \*\*Confidential Information.\*\* The software, including its user interface, features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.

&nbsp;       1. \*\*Use.\*\* For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.

&nbsp;       1. \*\*Survival.\*\* Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.

&nbsp;       1. \*\*Exclusions.\*\* You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental order.

1\. \*\*FEEDBACK.\*\* If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose.

You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

1\. \*\*SCOPE OF LICENSE.\*\* You may only use the software in Authorized Apps. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.

The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device. The first user may not retain any copies.

1\. \*\*EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.\*\* The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.

1\. \*\*ENTIRE AGREEMENT.\*\* This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

1\. \*\*APPLICABLE LAW.\*\*

&nbsp;   1. \*\*United States.\*\* If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

&nbsp;   1. \*\*Outside the United States.\*\* If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

1\. \*\*LEGAL EFFECT.\*\* This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

1\. \*\*DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\*\*

1\. \*\*LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.\*\*

&nbsp;   This limitation applies to



&nbsp;   - anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

&nbsp;   - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.



&nbsp;   It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
